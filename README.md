## Overview

Another project about layouting CSS and maximizing flexbox
now its about feature card.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

## My process

Basic HTML CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I found creating all the HTML is way so much better rather than doing HTML for 1 section and then do the CSS
layout roughly all the component in the website then do the css after that

### Continued development

I will move to another project based on CSS grid, then tomorrow learning about JavaScript
